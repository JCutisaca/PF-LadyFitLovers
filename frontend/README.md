# LADYFITLOVERS: women's sportswear and swimsuits e-commerce.

Our team presents LADYFITLOVERS, our final project developed during the bootcamp. This e-commerce platform focuses on female sports clothing and activewear, emphasizing a smooth user experience with features like secure authentication, streamlined payments, and user-friendly management tools.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
